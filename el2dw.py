"""
A script to post entries to Dreamwidth, Livejournal, and similar sites based on
a directory of Ello posts backed up using the el-takeaway tool. Post files must be named 'post-*.md'. Posts beginning with the @ character are excluded. Where more than one post is available, they will be posted in reverse-chronological order.

To install, make this file executable, then place in a directory in your executables path (e.g. ~/bin).

Usage: el2dw backup_dir -s service
