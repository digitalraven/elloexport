# ElloExport

Tools to take posts from an Ello backup created with [el-takeaway](https://github.com/leynos/el-takeaway) and export them to other platforms automatically.

Current efforts are on an automated crosspost for LiveJournal-based platforms.

## Usage

The various tools can be run with `cron`, automatically using `inotify` or `fswatch`, or run manually on a subset of posts.

## Disclaimers

Everything is provided AS IS. If it don't work, shit happens. It's a work in progress until it hits release, even then I wouldn't exactly call it bulletproof. It's a funky tool that I found useful, not something that I'm expecting world + dog to use.
